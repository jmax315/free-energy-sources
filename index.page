(<p>
"This site is for for is talking about various projects I'm working
on. Or have worked on. Or plan to work on. I may post occasional
essays on various things too, independent of any particular project, but
mostly, it's projects."  )

(<p>
"Lest anyone be misled by the title, this isn't about magic potions
that let cars run on water, how to sharpen your razors by putting them
in a pyramid, or cunning arrangements of crystals that let you tell
the electric company you won't be needing their services. (Well, that
last isn't quite true; I will get around to some solar-powered ideas,
and solar panels are, in fact, cunning arrangements of silicon
crystals that produce electricity...)"

(<p>
"I'll be updating this welcome page periodically to point to what I'm
working on at the moment."

(<p>
"I am, by profession, a computer programmer, and by avocation a science
and engineering geek, so most of these projects will be making widgets
of some kind, either hardware or software."
)

(<p>
"I'm decent with hardware, but " (<em> "good") " at software, so that bias may
show. I'm also a (not very active) ham radio operator, so there will
be some radio stuff too."

(<p>
"For a first project, I'm going to talk about using some clever Ruby
tricks to have a look inside Ruby on Rails:"
)

(<p>
 "In the near future, I'll be looking at a much less ambitious
project: A calculator for designing some specific electronic circuits,
implemented in React and running entirely in the browser. I'll
probably also get around to discussing how this site is built, at some
point." )



(<h3> "Comments and Feedback")

(<p>
 "I don't have a comments section on here, because I haven't found a
comment engine that I'm really happy with. Most of them seem to assume
you're running a WordPress site, which I'm not. I'll keep poking at
that issue; I'd like to have comments."

"In the meantime, you can reach me as jmax315, on gmail. That isn't
my primary address, but it does forward to it. (Gmail does a decent
job of spam filtering, which is why that's the address I'm putting out
here.)"

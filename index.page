"This isn't exactly a blog; I'm not going to be chronicling my
day-to-day life or anything like that. What it's for is talking about
various projects I'm working on. Or have worked on. Or plan to work
on. I may post occasional essays on various things too, indepent of
any particular project."

"Lest anyone be misled by the title, this isn't about magic potions
that let cars run on water, how to sharpen your razors by putting them
in a pyramid, or cunning arrangements of crystals that let you tell
the electric company you won't be needing their services. (Well, that
last isn't quite true; I will get around to some solar-powered ideas,
and solar panels are, in fact, cunning arrangements of silicon
crystals that produce electricity...)"

"I'll be updating this welcome page periodically to point to what I'm
working on at the moment; otherwise, my intent is to leave things
alone once I've posted them. Mostly, anyway; I reserve the right to
correct errors and add explanations. If I decide that something I've
written is just totally messed up, well, I'll deal with that when it
happens."

and engineering geek, so most of these projects will be making widgets
of some kind, either hardware or software."

"I'm decent with hardware, but " (<em> "good") " at software, so that bias may
show. I'm also a (not very active) ham radio operator, so there will
be some radio stuff too."

## What Shall We Look At?

I'm also going to need a guinea pig; since the purpose of this project
is to create a tool for exploring Rails projects, there better be a
Rails project to explore. I _could_ just create a generic Rails app,
but that feels a bit like cheating; I _know_ what the output of `rails
generate` looks like and does.

It seems better to me to take an existing Rails app, and use my tool
to open it up. After poking around Github's inventory of Rails
projects, I ended up choosing an open-government app created by some
folks in Spain: [consul](https://github.com/consul/consul)

A superficial examination showed it to be a pretty vanilla rails app;
they've got a moderately complex problem domain, and seem to be
following the usual Rails conventions. Experience and paranoia both
say that I'm probably missing one or more significant things with that
evaluation, but hey, finding those things is what *my* project is all
about.

After following the "how to setup for development" instructions in
their README, I have a working development copy that starts up,
listens on a TCP port, and handles HTTP requests; in short, a
functioning Rails app. I won't go into the details of that; there's
plenty of "getting started with Rails" content out there, and I don't
see any value in repeating it.

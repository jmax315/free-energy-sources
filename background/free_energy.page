"Why the site title, then, if I'm not trying to put the electric
company out of business? Well, way back in the misty dawn of time I
earned a bachelor's degree in physics. Amazingly, I still remember
some of it, and the title is a reference to thermodynamics.  Everybody
knows about entropy (not really, but a lot of folks seem willing to
talk about it without understanding it). Entropy is always increasing,
right? And it's something or other to do with disorder."

"But entropy has a less famous twin: enthalpy. It's sometimes called
the Gibbs free energy, or just free energy. Oversimplifying a bit, the
entropy of a closed system is the energy in the system that you can't
get any use out of, and the free energy is the energy that you " (<em> "can")
" get some use out of. So, if entropy is disorder, then its twin, free
energy, is order. And this site is an attempt to increase the order in
my universe of projects."  )

"(This is strictly a metaphor, by the way; to be precise about it, I'd
need to haul out mathematics. I'll trot out math as necessary in other
places on this site, but it isn't necessary here. In the specific case
of thermodynamics, I'd also have to haul out and review a textbook or
two; it's been a while, and I'd embarrass myself if I tried to talk
precisely about it off the cuff.)"

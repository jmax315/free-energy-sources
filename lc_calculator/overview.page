 "There's a kind of electronic circuit know as a filter, whose purpose
is to allow only certain frequencies through. If you've ever used an
old-school graphic equalizer on a sound system, or even bass and
treble knobs, you've been adjusting a filter circuit."
)

(<p>
"There are approximately a gazillion (plus minus a bazillion)
different kinds of filter circuits, but I'm particularly interested in
a specific kind of filter, known as an LC Ladder filter, for some of
the radio projects I'm noodling around with (None of them have come far
enough to be worth putting up on this site yet)."
)

(<p>
 "The calculations involved in designing such a filter circuit are
onerous enough that I don't want to do them by hand, but they really
aren't all that much for a computer to do. There's a variety of online
calculators for them out there, but none of them
is " (<em> "exactly") " what I want.")

(<p>
 "As I said, there isn't all that much arithmetic involved, for a
computer, but there are a bunch of parameters to twiddle. All of this
makes an in-browser calculator a nice fit for the problem. Because
it's in the browser, that makes the language choice simple:
JavaScript."

(<p>
 "A raw JavaScript application, however, can drive you crazy. It's
pretty easy to do simple things, but as you start adding features, you
quickly hit a threshold where the code has a tendency to become
overwhelming. And you generally hit that threshold without much warning."
 )

(<p>
 "To deal with the complexity problem, people have been creating
application frameworks for in-browser JavaScript for some time. Of the
current crop of frameworks, I prefer React."
 )

(<p>
 "So, that's the short-form description of the project: An in-browser
calculator, written in JavaScript/React, for designing LC ladder
filters."
